# Active Context: Dive AI Agent

## Current Focus
The current focus is on initializing the memory bank for the Dive AI Agent project. This is the first step in establishing a comprehensive documentation system that will help maintain continuity and context across development sessions.

## Recent Changes
- Created the memory bank directory structure
- Initialized core documentation files:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - activeContext.md (this file)
  - progress.md (to be created)

## Active Development Areas
Based on the open tabs in the editor, the following areas appear to be under active development:

1. **Database Services**: `services/database/index.ts` - Likely working on database connectivity and schema management
2. **UI Components**:
   - `src/components/SchedulerSidebar.tsx` - Scheduler functionality for planned operations
   - `src/components/HistorySidebar.tsx` - History management for past conversations
   - `src/components/Header.tsx` - Application header component
3. **State Management**: `src/atoms/sidebarState.ts` - Jotai atom for managing sidebar state
4. **Layout**: `src/views/Layout.tsx` - Main application layout
5. **Routing**: `services/routes/_index.ts` - API route definitions

## Next Steps
1. Complete the memory bank initialization by creating the progress.md file
2. Explore the codebase in more depth to understand:
   - Current implementation status of features
   - Any existing bugs or issues
   - Architecture details not apparent from high-level documentation
3. Create a .clinerules file to document project-specific patterns and preferences
4. Identify potential areas for improvement or enhancement
5. Establish a regular process for updating the memory bank as the project evolves

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Memory Bank Structure
- Decided to follow the hierarchical structure outlined in the custom instructions
- Ensured all core files are created with comprehensive initial content
- Structured content to be easily updatable as the project evolves

### Documentation Approach
- Focused on capturing both high-level concepts and technical details
- Used mermaid diagrams to visualize architecture and workflows
- Organized information in a way that supports quick reference and onboarding

### Project Understanding
- Need to deepen understanding of the MCP protocol implementation
- Should explore the relationship between the main process and services
- Would benefit from examining the database schema and data flow

## Open Questions
1. What is the current release cycle and versioning strategy?
2. Are there specific coding standards or patterns not immediately apparent from the codebase?
3. What are the priority features for upcoming releases?
4. How is testing currently implemented and what is the test coverage?
5. What is the deployment and release process?

## Current Environment
- Working in VSCode with multiple tabs open
- Project appears to be in active development
- Memory bank is being initialized for the first time
