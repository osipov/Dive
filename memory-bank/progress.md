- ðŸ”² Advanced conversation management features

## Known Issues
Without direct access to the issue tracker, specific known issues cannot be enumerated. However, based on the project structure and recent changes, these areas might have ongoing challenges:

- MCP server compatibility and security considerations
- Cross-platform consistency, especially for Windows builds
- Performance optimization for large conversation histories
- Token management and rate limiting for various LLM providers

## Development Roadmap
Based on the README and project structure, the development roadmap appears to include:

1. **Short-term**: Stabilize and enhance current features
   - Improve scheduler functionality
