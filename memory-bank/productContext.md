# Product Context: Dive AI Agent

## Problem Statement
The AI landscape is fragmented with multiple LLM providers, each with their own interfaces, capabilities, and limitations. Users who want to leverage different models for different tasks face several challenges:

1. Managing multiple API keys and configurations
2. Learning different interfaces and interaction patterns
3. Limited ability to extend AI capabilities with external tools
4. Inconsistent experience across different AI providers
5. Difficulty in creating a personalized AI experience

## Solution
Dive addresses these challenges by providing a unified desktop application that:

1. **Centralizes AI Access**: Manages multiple API keys and model configurations in one place
2. **Standardizes Interaction**: Provides a consistent chat interface regardless of the underlying model
3. **Extends AI Capabilities**: Implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable AI agents to access external tools and data
4. **Personalizes Experience**: Supports custom instructions and system prompts to tailor AI behavior
5. **Works Offline**: Functions as a desktop application without requiring constant internet connectivity (except for API calls)

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Users should be able to set up and start using the application with minimal configuration
- **Flexibility**: Support for various LLM providers and easy switching between models
- **Extensibility**: Ability to add custom MCP servers for specialized functionality
- **Consistency**: Uniform experience across different operating systems and LLM providers
- **Productivity**: Features like keyboard shortcuts and custom instructions to enhance workflow efficiency

## User Workflows
